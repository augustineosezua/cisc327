"""Notification simulator Assignment 3.

Place this file beside run.py in your selected project folder, then use
``import notification_service`` from application code.

This module does not send real emails or make network calls. Successful
notifications are stored in memory and disappear when Python exits. It is
a teaching simulator for a single process, not a production delivery system.
The application decides when to notify someone and how to handle failure.

Examples of recipients in the supplied templates:
    Library:          member.email
    Equipment rental: renter.email
    Inventory:        supplier.contact_email or a chosen staff address

For application tests, stub send_notification to return True or False, or
mock it to verify the recipient, subject, and message. Assert the resulting
application behavior too. Patch the dependency where your application uses it.
Use clear_notifications before and after tests that use the real simulator.
